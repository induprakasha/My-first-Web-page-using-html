                        <p><b>Student of law</b> Gandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay.[52] Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London.[53] In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, Harilal.[54] His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.[51][55]


                            Gandhi in London as a law student
                            On 10 August 1888, Gandhi aged 18, left Porbandar for Mumbai, then known as Bombay. Upon arrival, he stayed with the local Modh Bania community whose elders warned him that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in Western ways. Despite Gandhi informing them of his promise to his mother and her blessings, he was excommunicated from his caste. Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London, with his brother seeing him off.[54][56] Gandhi attended University College, London, a constituent college of the University of London.</p>
                            <h1>Civil rights activist in South Africa (1893–1914)</h1>
                            <p><i>In April 1893, Gandhi aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin.[63][64] He spent 21 years in South Africa, where he developed his political views, ethics and politics.[65][66]

                                Immediately upon arriving in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination because of his skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour.[67] He was not allowed to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class.[68][69] He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights.[69] He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day.[70] In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do.[71] Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.[72]
                                
                                When Gandhi arrived in South Africa, according to Herman, he thought of himself as "a Briton first, and an Indian second".[73] However, the prejudice against him and his fellow Indians from British people that Gandhi experienced and observed deeply bothered him. He found it humiliating, struggling to understand how some people can feel honour or superiority or pleasure in such inhu</i></p>
                               
                                <h2>Struggle for Indian independence (1915–1947) </h2>
                                <p>At the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to him by C. F. Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.

                                    Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.[94]</p>

                                        <li>The word Mahatma, while often mistaken for Gandhi's given name in the West, is taken from the Sanskrit words maha (meaning Great) and atma (meaning Soul). Rabindranath Tagore is said to have accorded the title to Gandhi.[399][b] In his autobiography, Gandhi nevertheless explains that he never valued the title, and was often pained by it.[402][403][404]
                                            Innumerable streets, roads and localities in India are named after Gandhi. These include M.G.Road (the main street of a number of Indian cities including Mumbai and Bangalore), Gandhi Market (near Sion, Mumbai) and Gandhinagar (the capital of the state of Gujarat, Gandhi's birthplace).[405]
                                            Florian asteroid 120461 Gandhi was named in his honour in September 2020.[406</li>
